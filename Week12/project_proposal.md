# Final project proposal

For the final I want to continue the website I made for the midterm. 

## To do: 

\
\
### 1. fill in mssing pages. 

none of these pages exist yet
![ portfolio page](<portfolio_page.png>)

The contact pages is also missing, but I don't want that default contact sheet because I want to the look to remain consistent. perhaps an email link

\
\
### 2. custom playback buttons?

I would like to hand draw working custom playback buttons if this is a reasonable goal. This would be for audio clips.

\
\
### 3. Figure out the cursor situation

I drew this custom cursor but i'm torn about it, I'll play around with the look and see if I want to keep it. 
Also sometimes it doesn't work and I have no idea why

### 4. Add the the FAQs section

I would like to add more questions to this page, but succesively, so that another question appears after the last one is answered.
 I would like this to lead down a rabbit hole with many other pages.
